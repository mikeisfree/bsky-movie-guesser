# Progress: Bsky Movie Guesser

## What Works

- ‚úÖ Movie selection from TMDB API
- ‚úÖ Image processing pipeline (optimization, censoring, watermarking)
- ‚úÖ BlueSky posting functionality
- ‚úÖ Reply collection and analysis
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy matching for answer evaluation
- ‚úÖ Results calculation and posting
- ‚úÖ Automatic round transitions
- ‚úÖ Basic error handling and recovery

## What's Left to Build

### In Progress

- üîÑ Custom trivia question source

  - Schema design complete
  - Implementation pending

- üîÑ Player tracking system
  - Preliminary database design complete
  - Implementation not started

### Not Started

- ‚è≥ Tournament functionality
- ‚è≥ Web interface for leaderboards
- ‚è≥ Additional question sources
- ‚è≥ Enhanced analytics
- ‚è≥ Admin controls for game parameters

## Current Status

The bot is operational with its core movie guessing functionality. It successfully:

1. Selects random movies
2. Processes and posts images
3. Evaluates responses
4. Posts results
5. Continues to new rounds

Development is now focusing on expanding features and enhancing user engagement through player tracking and tournaments.

## Known Issues

- Occasional timeouts with TMDB API during peak times
- Some movie titles with special formatting cause matching inconsistencies
- Very short movie titles sometimes have higher false positive matches

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially planned for only movie guessing, now expanding to multiple question types
- Originally manual round initiation, evolved to fully automated operation
- Started with exact string matching, moved to fuzzy matching for better user experience
