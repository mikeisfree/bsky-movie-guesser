# Progress: BlueTrivia

## What Works

- ‚úÖ Movie question source using TMDB API
- ‚úÖ Trivia question source using custom database
- ‚úÖ Question source interface for extensible question types
- ‚úÖ Image processing pipeline (optimization, censoring, watermarking)
- ‚úÖ BlueSky posting and interaction
- ‚úÖ Reply collection and analysis
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy matching for answer evaluation
- ‚úÖ Results calculation and posting
- ‚úÖ Automatic round transitions
- ‚úÖ Database schema for tracking rounds and posts
- ‚úÖ Player response tracking with position and timing
- ‚úÖ Post length management for BlueSky's character limit
- ‚úÖ Environment variable loading from .env files

## What's Left to Build

### In Progress

- üîÑ Tournament functionality

  - Schema created
  - Player tracking mechanism implemented
  - Tournament creation and scoring not yet implemented

- üîÑ Player statistics and leaderboards
  - Basic tracking implemented
  - UI for displaying leaderboards not implemented
  - Player commands to view stats not implemented

### Not Started

- ‚è≥ Web interface for leaderboards and statistics
- ‚è≥ Additional question sources beyond movies and trivia
- ‚è≥ Advanced analytics for game performance
- ‚è≥ Admin controls for game parameters

## Current Status

The bot is operational in test mode with 1-minute rounds. It successfully:

1. Selects random questions from multiple sources
2. Posts questions with appropriate formatting
3. Evaluates user responses
4. Tracks player statistics and response timing
5. Posts results (with character limit management)
6. Continues to new rounds automatically

There are still some issues with BlueSky post character limits when trying to include detailed player information in result posts.

## Known Issues

- Post character limit occasionally causes truncated result posts
- Database schema migrations need careful handling for backward compatibility
- Error handling for API failures could be more robust
- Tournament functionality is partially implemented but not fully tested

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Originally designed for movie guessing only, now supports multiple question types
- Initially planned for manual round initiation, evolved to fully automated operation
- Started with exact string matching, moved to fuzzy matching for better user experience
- Originally had fixed post formats, now uses component-based format to handle character limits
- Added player tracking and response timing to support leaderboards and tournaments
